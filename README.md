# Frontend

## **NOTE**
The frontend often fails to start on Codio due to a lack of memory. It may take a few attempts for the code to start.

## Setup

In `src/config.js` the `baseUrl` property should be set to that of the root of the API.
E.g. `https://canoe-janet-3000.codio-box.uk/api/v1`.

## Starting

To start the frontend, first start the backend API. Then the frontend can be started with `npm start`.
