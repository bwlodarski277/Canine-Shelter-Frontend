# Canine Shelter Frontend

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3bf42866-6194-48b6-9944-3dc06e8a2e49/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/canine-shelter/deploys)

## **NOTE**

The frontend often fails to start on Codio due to a lack of memory. It may take a few attempts for the code to start.

## Setup

In `src/config.js` the `baseUrl` property should be set to that of the root of the API.
E.g. `https://canoe-janet-3000.codio-box.uk/api/v1`.

## Starting

To start the frontend, first start the backend API. Then the frontend can be started with `npm start`.
